The Hackathon details

The Robot Rave [The Hackathon] - London Saturday, January 17

​Cocoa and SoTA (Society for Technological Advancement) invite you to The Robot Rave — a hackathon-meets-performance where engineers, founders, and artists will make robots dance.

​The day culminates in a Robot Dance Competition at Maggie’s, London’s iconic 80s club, followed by humans taking over the dance floor to continue the rave.

​At Cocoa and SoTA we believe in the importance of culture for technoscientific progress. We have partnered to celebrate the 2nd birthday since SoTA's inception and the launch of Cocoa II together.

​And what more human way to celebrate the culture of technological progress, optimism, and ambition than a dancing robot – the ultimate expression of the joy and hope we want to cultivate for the future.
